                Orange County and the Vietnamese Community
            </h1>
            <p>
                Orange County, California: home to Disneyland, scenic beaches, and 3 million people within its 800 square miles. A perfect suburbia, “a bastion of conservatism, affluence, white privilege, and uncontrolled sprawl;” but beyond the palm trees, the oil rigs, and the perfectly planned out cities lies a refuge for a people preserved in time, a Saigon never forgotten, and new generations being born intricately tied to a home that lives solely in the echoes of the past.

            <p>
                Until the 20th century, Orange County was still burgeoning into suburbia propelled by the economic prosperity sparked by the Gold Rush and thriving coastal harbors. During this time, Caucasians with overwhelmingly Republican views predominantly inhabited the area, shaping a political landscape that mirrored their demographic dominance. However, the 1970s brought about a significant transformation as Vietnamese refugees poured into the area, melding the culture of Saigon into Orange County's own.

            <p>
                With a population of nearly 200,000 Vietnamese Americans, Orange County stands as the largest community of ethnically Vietnamese people outside of Vietnam itself. Within it lies Little Saigon, a semblance of Vietnamese culture and heritage within the intricate social fabric of Southern California. The enclave serves as a testament to the resilience and dedication exhibited by Vietnamese refugees who sought to create a home in America. But, how did Little Saigon come to be? And how will a town so rooted in the past adapt to the aspirations of its new generations?
