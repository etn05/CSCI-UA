I will be making an interactive portfolio website about my work thus far. The home page will be an introduction to myself, or an “About” page. There will be five total pages that will be listed underneath a toggle navigation bar svg. These pages will consist of: Home, About, Projects, Education/Experience, and Contact. The project page will have links to my work (work from this class, work from personal projects, and some academic papers). My education and experience page will have a description of my education and all the jobs/volunteering work I have done. Finally, my contact page will have a form that sends an email to me.
