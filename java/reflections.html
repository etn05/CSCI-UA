                Growing up, I wanted to escape the confines of Little Saigon, I yearned for an upbringing like my mother’s— one surrounded by white people, the “real Americans.” Nestled within its little bubble, it wasn’t until I ventured out of Orange County that I realized how much it meant to me, how much it means to all of us. Little Saigon exudes a sense of being sheltered by design; it stands as a tangible refuge meticulously constructed to mirror a land we once called home. In hindsight, it becomes evident that our migration to Little Saigon was driven by our shared pursuit of community. Even today, my strongest connections are fostered in Orange County where our narratives intertwine, weaving similar stories of heritage and experience. Our parents, who arrived on fisher’s boats, incessantly remind us of their arduous journey to America; as remediation, we devoted our childhoods to praising God for the blessings He bestowed upon our families and diligently pursuing the education that eluded our parents. Although I was afforded the privilege of a “fully American” childhood, I still find profound solace in the embrace of Little Saigon and its people. The bumpy roads, the aromatic Pho shops, the solemnity of the churches we frequent, the Vietnamese signage you couldn’t find anywhere else in America, the distinct, if somewhat jarring to an outsider, cadence Vietnamese people converse in— it all means home to me. Even when visiting Vietnam itself, the indisputable belonging I searched for escaped me; instead, it revealed itself in Little Saigon. There, a unique culture unfurls— a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship, labor, and love.

                Ultimately, there would be no Orange County without Little Saigon, without the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees whose efforts not only forged a home in America but also bestowed California with a cultural history that is an indelible part of its identity.

                I urge the children like me, those who inherited the legacies of our parents —both the burdens of trauma and the blessings of love—to champion the memory of Little Saigon. As the scatterings of the “American” war fade and we depart from our ông bà (grandparents), it becomes our responsibility to nurture the sanctuary they ardently built. Though we cannot linger in the past that our elders might, we will safeguard the essence of places like Little Saigon, defining what it means to be Vietnamese-American without forsaking our roots for the “American dream,” but instead fulfilling our own.
