                Following South Vietnam's defeat in a ten-year civil war that America insisted on fighting in, a mass exodus of 130,000 refugees ensued. Driven by a fear of the new Việt Cộng rule, Vietnamese southerners and northern migrants evacuated prior to April 30, 1975. Many of these refugees were sent to the makeshift tent cities of Fort Indiantown Gap in Pennsylvania, Camp Pendleton in California, Fort Chaffee in Arkansas, or the Eglin Air Force in Florida. This is an enduring narrative beholden to many family histories within the Vietnamese diaspora, one that enshrines escapes on fishing boats and a convergence in transient living spaces. These stories have left an indelible mark on the Vietnamese-American identity, inextricably uniting us through the shared hardships that characterize the foundation of our lives in America.

                Despite the fleeting nature of these tented circumstances, refugees managed to cultivate a sense of community by organizing religious services, publishing poetry, attending music concerts, and, in true Vietnamese fashion, schedule dozens of wedding parties (Nguyen, 2015). For Orange County in particular, the community they formed in the transient campsite laid the foundation for the large ethnic enclave the area is today. In the 1970s Orange County was “still a suburban metropolis in the making” with a population comprising of 1,421,233, who were nearly all white (Nguyen, 2015). Despite the widespread conservative political views and economic instability of the time, the Orange County Register wrote that they “must accommodate [Vietnamese refugees], absolutely must;” and that despite the anticipated strain on the struggling job market, it was necessary to consider the “moral imperative.” At the end of the day, what more could these guilt-ridden white Americans do for the South Vietnamese refugees after they had failed to “protect” them from communism?

                Seventy-five percent of Vietnamese refugees found shelter in America through faith-based organizations. Among them were my own family, who settled within a Catholic Church situated in rural Pennsylvania. In Lykens, a town where people of color were seldom seen, a community took it upon themselves to teach my family— entirely unfamiliar with American customs— English, offer them factory jobs, and assist in their assimilation. Vietnamese refugees were notably granted entrance into America off of a moral obligation, not a legal one, so churches and communities like these constructed a sort of moral shield to foster these individuals.

                While small Vietnamese communities emerged outside of Southern California, none were as centralized as that of Orange County’s. With the churches’ efforts in uniting families, almost twenty thousand Vietnamese refugees had been resettled all over Southern California by the end of 1975.
                Over time, Little Saigon experienced remarkable growth as people sought out familiar food, homes, and a general sense of belonging in Orange County. The emergence of numerous Asian-owned businesses played a crucial role in revitalizing Orange County's once-struggling economy. Before long, Little Saigon was officially recognized as a “Special Tourist Zone” in June of 1988 at Phước Lộc Thọ, the iconic Asian Garden Mall built the previous year. Various cultural mediums emerged, with newspapers, radios, and television facilitating connectivity within the Vietnamese community. Subsequently, the population had grown exponentially with other first-wave refugees coming from across the states and directly from Southeast Asia (Nguyen, 2015). With all of these new developments, a lost city had been resurrected.
